3. I'm 26 years old. I have been working as a guitar teacher at a children's music school for 6 years. My strengths: *discipline, decency, ability to think coolly, rationality, ability to work in a team.* My training is now the first non-superficial. I studied HTML and CSS languages even before I learned about RS Scool and tried to make my first website in the Dreamweaver program based on them. I managed to do *Index.html* and a few more pages with a drop-down menu and beautiful animations. As soon as I entered the University, I didn't have time to do this, and after graduation I started to dive back into it, but now it has reached a different level. Before I was prompted about RS Scool I was solving 8kyu level problems on codewars.com and I took a free video course on HTML and CSS. I learned the requirements for the student and began to prepare in three areas: English (**pulled it up to the A2 level**) and JS for learn javascript. **There is not a single day** when I don't watch YouTube streams of the school from previous sets and learn something new to improve my code.
4. CSS,HTML,JS,Git,Visual Studio Code

    return false;
  } else if (n === 2) {
    return true;
  }

  let i = 2;
  const limit = Math.sqrt(n);
  while (i <= limit) {
    if (n % i === 0) {
      return false;
    }
    i +=1;
  }
  
  return true;
}
